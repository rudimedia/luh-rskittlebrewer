# Whats our goal?
Can we predict where and when accidents might happen more often so that resources for emergency units can be appropiately managed in advance?

# How?
We trained a Machine Learning Algorithm on the data so that for every possible combination of X-Values it would be able to output a guess for the corresponding Y-Values. This gives us the assumed severity of a accident if it would happen given these conditions.

Thats not terribly useful. We need to know IF an accident is going to happen or not.

To do this, we randomised the X-Values for thousands of hours, days and weeks so that we'd have a dataset which we could reference. These datapoints are being assumed to be non-accident values. These non-accident values are being compared to the accident values to get the probabilities given each
